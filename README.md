# CS-300
This is my Github submission for CS-300 from SNHU


What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    The problem that was to be solved for this course was opening a file, splitting that file, organizing the data, and being able to call the correct set of information from that original file. In some assignments we even had to add and delete it!
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    Honestly, I kind of just started writing and see what worked and what didn't. I think they're important to understand becuase they are essential to being able to wrtie code. A lot of today's industries are headed towards data analysis with machine learning. Besides that it's a great way to practice problem solving.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    I used Google and the C++ reference website A LOT! I also would take breaks when I was overwhelemed and came back after a little bit, had to remind myself to eat and such. I also also talked to my insturctor a couple times through email.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    I was never great at C++, so this class has helped with understanding that. I can now easily look at a program and figure out what it's trying to do, why it's doing what it's doing, and how to develop my own code from the references (lots of zybook and stackoverflow examples). 
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    I think it helped me because it showed me that it's not always easy to know what other people have in mind when writing the code. I have made my comments easier to read and understand now (not that they weren't before I just changed them up a little bit).
